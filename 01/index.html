    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id='description'>
        RO.ME is an interactive music video for the song "3 Dreams of Black" by Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi, and Norah Jones.
        The music video utilizes WebGL to give an interactive experience with the user, allowing them to look around the
        music video with just mouse movement. The video also features 2D and 3D graphics, as well as video. Aside from just
        looking around, some scenes also generate objects at the cursor location, such as grass, birds, deer, etc. Other scenes
        also alter how the music video looks around the cursor, changing the background into triangle-like pixels in a radius.
        The video also features a wide variety of environments, including scenes inside a car, in a building, on train-tracks,
        and in a desert. The interactive music video was created in 2013 and was one-of-a-kind, and so its use of WebGL was
        quite instrumental in creating awareness of the technology and what it could do!

      <p id='technology'>
        Technology: The interactive film RO.ME was created using several technologies, including WebGL, JavaScript, and HTML5!
        In particular, WebGL is hardware accelerated, so it enables the use of your computer's video/graphics card to render the
        graphics of the interactive movie! Moreover, WebGL relies on HTML's canvas element and JavaScript to deliver the experience.
      <p id='comparison'>
        Comparison: The interactive story I have chosen is called <a href="https://www.airforce.com/intothestorm/">Into The Storm</a>
        from the U.S. Air Force. There are quite a few differences between Into The Storm and RO.ME. While both are interactive
        stories utilizing WebGL, Into The Storm tells a story of a rescue mission whereas RO.ME is an interactive music video. Another difference
        is that the interactive elements of both stories are quite different. For example, in RO.ME the location of the cursor
        may either cause a camera effect or generate grass and plants at its location. In Into The Storm however, there is scrolling
        to traverse a mountain, click-dragging to land a helicopter, and so on. There are also points in which the user can click
        on text boxes, which will lead to an Air Force member describing their journey or providing advice on what to do in
        dangerous situations. Another difference is that, while RO.ME intertwines video with interactive elements, the entirety
        of Into The Storm is interactive; there are no video elements.
