      film that was highly interactive that allowed the user to interact with their cursor that allowed live changes to whatever environment they were in. Incredibly immersive with super responsive actions. Essentially an interactive music video.

      <h2>Why Ryan Hates Mondays </h2>
      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: "choosnik's diary, Why does Ryan hate Mondays" is a WebGL gamified adventure, a point and click character of a small yellow bear with comic panel artstyle. The objective is to find all four collectibles and find out why Ryan hates Mondays. the background is grid paper and all objects seem to be drawn things coming into animation. This is also made with WebGL. Compared to the 3 Dreams of Black. Choosnik's Diary is more of a game where you lead your character whereas the previous experience was a music video where the user can affect the environment in real time
