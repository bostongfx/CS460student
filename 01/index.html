    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The RO.ME demo was pretty cool, half way through the demo I even thought that
      it would go on forever and that I had to close the demo in order to stop it. 
      It's crazy to think that they could've made something this complex 13 years ago. 
      It also served as a template, paving the way for future demos.

      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: WebGl, Java.script, Html, and a browser such as google chrome <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: https://quantumstretch.com/ <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      I personally like the RO.ME experience. This new demo about quantum is informational, however it's kind of boring. 
      But at the same time the graphic design of the quantum better is a lot better and more smooth.
