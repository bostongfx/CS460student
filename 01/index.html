    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      Description: RO.ME was a very interesting graphic demo. At first, 
      it shows very realistic non-interactive graphic visuals. It then transitions into cartoon-looking slightly-interactive visuals, kind of
      symbolizing going from an awake-state to an asleep-state.
      <br></br>
      
      Then it transitioned into an interactive scene where visuals would 
      change and follow where my cursor/pointer was located.
      <br></br>

      This happened about 2-3 more times and ended with a final interactive scene where you fly around freely
      as a flock of birds.
      <br></br>

      I found this extremely cool since it's also been an interest of mine to turn my own dreams into playable
      demos just like this one. Looking at history aswell, RO.ME was released in June 2011, but was already in development by May 2011. 
      This is only a couple months after the first version WebGL was released, and yet the visuals were absolutely stunning. I was
      9 years old when this came out, I didn't even know what an "Web Browser" was, let alone these sort of visuals were being created in 
      them.

      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: RO.ME was made using WebGL. WebGL is an extension of JavaScript, and with the help
      of HTML (5), it can make 3D interactive experiences. WebGL is hardware-accelerated which uses
      your graphics card to do the rendering.
      </p>

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: For my comparison, I decided to compare it to <a href="https://lusion.co/">lusion.co</a>.
      In Lusion, it's fully interactive in comparison to RO.ME. It's an interactive website that allows you to scroll/move at your own 
      pace and be able to fully and slowly explore the graphical visuals presented. In RO.ME, you were only able to interact during
      certain scenes/visuals. In Lusion, there's plenty of more variety in their visuals such as: visuals when hovering buttons, visuals 
      going across the screen while scrolling, moving text and images/videos, visuals with slight interaction, such as looking around, and
      many more.
