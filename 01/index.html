    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id='description'>
      The RO.ME demo was very interesting, and reminded me of many websites I've frequented before. Created around 2011, as a collaboration between workers at Google, 
      it seems to be a forefront example of the emerging capabilities of WebGL. It was an immersive experience, especially for its time without the need for plugins like Flash. 
      This was revolutionary because similar experiences for websites back then required additional plugins.<br>
      The impacts would presumably be popularizing WebGL and the use of 3D graphics in the browser. Lately I've seen more and more websites testing the capabilities
      of WebGL for creating browser-based games. This would lead to a trend toward more immersive web experiences, such as 3D maps, virtual reality in the browser, and even more
      visualizations. The showcase that DE.MO provided was very innovative, providing a base for future websites to get influence from.

      <p id='comparison'>

      Comparison: You can compare the RO.ME demo to other WebGL projects such as <a href="https://wldlght.com/" target="_blank">WLDLGHT</a>. Both of these projects
        focus on a great digital experience but the execution between the two are very different. To specify, one of WLDLGHT's main tool was a tool called MadMapper.
        To explain, it maps video, light, LED, and laser content. Thus, WLDLIGHT focused on blending lights on real settings using the mapping software,
        to add immersive environments ain the real world. In their about company section, they talk about how weather affected their design.
