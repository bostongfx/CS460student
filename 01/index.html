    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id="description">
        <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
        RO.ME is a very interesting webgl demo! I really like the nostalgic
        music it plays in the background and the way the camera moves around the
        scene. It feels like a story-mode game. It was very surprising to find
        out that it was made more than a decade ago and the graphics and
        everything still look amazing. I think it definitely had a major impact
        on what can be done in the browser just by using webgl. I believe the
        time this web game was made was also the time when I used to play online
        web games on miniclip.com and now I know how they were made as well.

        <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
        <img id="screenshot" src="./assets/CloudCastles_Screenshot.png" />
        Comparison: Another webgl demo that I found was the
        <a href="https://www.cloudcastles.gg">Cloud Castles</a>. It displays
        floating rocks with each rock having a warrior or dragon or something
        along those lines on top of them. The interaction with this demo is very
        limited compared to RO.ME as you can only move from one castle to
        another. The camera view is fixed and it doesn't have a video like
        RO.ME. The graphics are pretty modern and I relly like the setting of
        the demo mostly because I really like mythical creatures, especially
        dragons. This demo reminds me a lot of Game of Thrones and The Elder
        Scrolls video game series.
