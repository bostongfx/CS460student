      <p id='description'>
        "3 Dreams of Black," is an interactive WebGL experience created with Google. It was released in 2011, 
        it was huge news for its use of real-time 3D rendering directly in the browser without plugins, it was more of an add-on. 
        The demo tells a story through three different worlds, combining music, art, and animation to create a mesmerizing experience. 
        At the time, it demonstrated the possibilities of WebGL technology, proving that detailed and visually captivating content 
        could be presented directly on the web.
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo!

      Comparison: I chose the <a href='https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/3d-music-album-navigation-sirup' target='_blank'>3D Music Album Navigation - SIRUP</a> 
      from the SIRUP 5th Anniversary Site. both the SIRUP album navigation and RO.ME 3 Dreams of Black use WebGL for interactive 3D experiences, 
      but their focus is different. RO.ME is more of an artistic, dreamlike journey that blends storytelling, animation, and music, 
      guiding users through different worlds while  the SIRUP project is a visually engaging way to navigate music albums, 
      focusing on user interaction with albums and the artist's music.
