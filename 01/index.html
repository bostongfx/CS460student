      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The "3 DREAMS OF BLACK" demo, created in 2010 and launched in 2011 by Danger Mouse, Luppi, White, and Jones, is a pioneering WebGL project that merges 2D and 3D graphics with video.This is like the coolest website I have ever seen! The 3D graphics really resemble that of some modern-day video games!  This innovative work showcases real-time rendering capabilities, effectively turning web browsers into interactive gaming platforms. By pushing the boundaries of web content beyond simple text and images, WebGL enables immersive experiences. The demo has profoundly influenced web development by demonstrating WebGL's potential to revolutionize online 3D graphics, leading to greater adoption of immersive technologies in sectors such as gaming, education, and virtual tours. Its impact is rooted in showing how advanced storytelling and graphics can be seamlessly delivered through the web.

      Technology used in 3 Dreams of Black include:

      1.	WebGL - for rendering hardware-accelerated 3D graphics in the browser.
      2.	GLSL - for real-time shaders and visual effects.
      3.	Three.js - a JavaScript library that simplifies WebGL usage.
      4.	Marching Cubes Algorithm - for generating complex geometries like metaballs.
      5.	Normal Mapping - for simulating detailed textures.
      6.	Audio API - for integrating sound in real-time.

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: In my view, the Air Force website focuses on recruiting and engaging visitors with high-quality visuals and interactive elements, while the RO.ME demo highlights how to integrate and animate 3D models on websites, emphasizing technical functionality. <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
        <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.airforce.com/intothestorm/" target="_blank">Air Force's "Into the Storm"</a> website to experience their engaging and immersive recruitment content featuring high-quality visuals and interactive elements.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the <a href="https://bostongfx.github.io/tech/" target="_blank">RO.ME demo</a> highlights the technical integration of 3D models into web pages, focusing on showcasing interactive and animated features rather than engagement.</p>
