    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <img id='screenshot' src='ss.png'>
      <p id='description'>
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! This demo is somthing that we take for granted today because
      of all the websites that use features like this. Before we had this technology everywhere, I 
      remember buying a custom pair of shoes as a kid and on the nike store there was a "3d" model
      of them. But it was actually just a few images of the shoes from different angles that was 
      giving the poor illusion of 3d. Now a days we expect 3b models to all be super fast and 
      high quality like the modern day shoe customization.

      Technology: webgl in html5

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: I did <a href="https://dillasdonuts.shop/">dillasdonuts</a> and this an 
      interactive page where you can click on donuts and they will play a jdilla beat. In terms of
      comparison this website looks waaaay better than rome does. The video quality is much higher 
      and the models have a lot more pollygons than there are in rome.
