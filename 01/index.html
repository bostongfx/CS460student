  <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <p id='description'>
      Rome was a super interesting browser-based interactive movie / music video! It's great to see developers
      collaborating with artsts in this way, and it seems like it was a great strategy for bringing some attention /
      showing off what WebGL can do.
    </p>
    <p id='technology'>
      Technology: The technologies used in the project were WebGL and THREE.js. It's interesting that THREE.js never
      gets mentioned in the <a href="https://bostongfx.github.io/tech/">tech video</a>, but you can see in the console
      and in some of the B-Roll in the video that they're using THREE.js.
    </p>
    <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: My favorite other intractive story was <a href="https://dillasdonuts.shop/">dillasdonuts.shop</a>!
      It's a site that showcases an album that I really like by an artist who has long since passed. It's a great way of
      preserving his legacy, and it also just looks really cool. Like RO.ME, it uses THREE.js, but has more of a
      traditionaly website user flow, with different pages to view different songs off of Dilla's album.
    </p>
