    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The RO.ME demo is a music video and is also like a strange dream, 
      swapping between eating beans, being in an empty city, being on 
      a train, and then being in a desert and controlling (or becoming?) 
      a flock of birds to beautiful music. The visuals are amazing, where 
      some parts of the video are almost monochrome and others are very 
      vibrant. Overall, it's just absolutely beautiful.

      Technology: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      This demo uses WebGL, Three.js and JavaScript, and HTML allowing for 
      the amazing 3D graphics to be seen on your own browser. 2D graphics 
      are also used in ROME, like in the opening with the fire and the can
      of beans. The graphics are all rendered through the use of your video
      card. Three.js was the JavaScript library the creators used.

      Comparison: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      https://persepolis.getty.edu/ 
      Persepolis Reimagined isn’t a music video, instead it’s a look into a
      time passed. You get to see parts of Persepolis in the present and how
      it’s imagined to have looked in the past. Some text seen throughout 
      the online tour is also translated and then recorded in English, which 
      is a very interesting listen in my opinion. There’s also text shown when
      you stop at certain parts of the city, telling you about why a statue was
      there or why something was removed. You get to learn about how people lived
      in the city in the past, why it was built the way it was, and how things 
      changed, which is so cool to me. There is music playing during it, but it’s 
      not at all like the song in ROME, as there’s no lyrics. The graphics are very
      different from ROME’s, seeming more realistic in comparison as well.
