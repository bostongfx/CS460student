      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! It takes place in the first person point of view (the user of the site is experiencing the web around them
      like the person in the site). The person goes through various sceneries, which include waking up in a room, driving through the street and
      even a train ride. As the person is going through these different places the world around the user morphs into different animals and plants,
      and it even transforms those animals into different ones very smoothly. It is a cool web to look at at least once.
      I really liked it, because it wasn't hyperrealistic like other models and you could tell that it was created by using code and such.
      I also liked the fact that it was the point of view of the person in the video like as the viewer we were experiencing it, and that
      made the experience better since it was like the movmenets of looking around like ones I would do too. It's honestly so impressive
      the way it was made and this aspect of cs has me really interested in what I could potentially do with it.

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison:  <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      I compared the ROME site to The Azarian Journey [link above].
      This site was a lot calmer than the ROME site, in the sense that the music and story line were
      very tame and there wasn't a lot of overstimulation, but I liked both sites in their own way.
      In this site you weren't able to move around so much, but the story was spoken to you and
      you could choose between French and English which I thought was a cool feature. One thing I did
      like about the Azarian Journey was that there were different pin points along the bottom if you
      wanted to jump back and forth between different segments, but for the ROME site you had to
      rewatch the whole thing just to see one aspect again. Both were super cool sites though, I hope
      my final proj can be cool like those lol
