        Description: A person is driving through dystopian world. They fall asleep in an abanonded building and experience another world within their reality; animals running through a colorful landscape.
        It cuts to someone traveling the world while on top of a train. They go through the praries and mountains, there are buffalo, deer and other animals running along the way.
        The next time they wake up, they pull a lever and end up in a desert. They start walking then become a bird of a flock, fully immersed in the other world. Throughout each scene,
        I was able to interact with the environment with my mouse. And as a bird, I was able to fly to the several structures in the sky.

      <p id='comparison'>
        Comparison:
        <a href="https://www.no-fishing.net/">No Fishing Net</a> was a PSA about overfishing. The message is that we're overfishing to the point we'll eventually have fishing nets but no fish.
        Compared to RO.ME, No Fishing Net was more interactive on each page using WebGL. My favorite was the donation page. It is boat in the ocean and there is a circle around it. The circle represents
        the amount of ocean that will be protected given your donation, and increases to vast amounts as the donation slider increases.
        There was also a rendering of the Earth. It emphasizes the majority of the planet is ocean. It was pleasing how natural the water looked as well.
