      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! It was very interesting to see how I could interact with the film. The demo was basically like an interactive music video where there was many different scenes of the video you could interact with. There was limited things to which you could do but you could see and move your curser around on different scenes to do different things as the scene was playing,

      Technology: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      WebGl, Javascript, Three.js

      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: Compared with the RO.ME demo the lusion.co website uses WebGL as the user scrolls throught the website. There are many different elements that you can interact with your cursor like the in the RO.ME demo but there is way more visual effects in the lusion.co website.
