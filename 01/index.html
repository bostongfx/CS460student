      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      It feels like we were watching a film and playing a game at a same time, our character is just keep moving forward and the film allows us
      to steer around in 360 degrees and when we reach the desert we can just freely move around.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: TODO! <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      This short film was using WebGL and it could steer itself through the narratives.The HTML5 canvas element of the WEBGL enables hardware-accelerated
      3D graphics in the web browser.
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: TODO! <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON --> https://wldlght.com/# this WebGL example is another interactive film but is more static than
      RO.ME as in RO.ME we can move around in 360 degrees but with wldlght project is more of 180 degrees and we can only choose to go inside the temple
      there are not much similarities between the two as in both we can interact with the film. In wldlght we can choose to change the color of the temple.
