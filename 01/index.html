    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <p id='description'>
      RO.ME is a web experience created to showcase multiple technologies
      and as the video for the song black which brought together many talent
      both in the tech word an the music industry. The web experience is not
      just a simple video but is a real time render of different graphics blended
      in with a video, all interactive. 
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      The technology used to create RO.ME are mainly WebGL and Three.js with multiple
      layers of complexity such as GLSL for shading, mapping, depth of field and 3D mouse 
      movements. Ofc HTML5 and a sprinkle of css.
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      <a href="https://www.cloudcastles.gg/gameplay" target="_blank">Cloud castle</a> is an immersive 3D 
      world in the sky that is very similar to RO.ME in many ways, first the both use WebGL
      and they also share the 3D mouse movement which make everything more immersive together 
      what I would call a parallax effect, they also use a lot of intractable 3D models and sounds. What I find different is that on Cloud Castle the user is more
      in charge of the narration than in RO.ME.
