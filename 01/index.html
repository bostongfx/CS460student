    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->
      <img id='screenshot' src='screenshot.png'>
      <p id='description'>
      Three different dreams play out.
      Driving through a city desolated by decay.
      Riding a train alongside wildlife.
      Flying across the badlands, bringing life to all you see.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: A base of HTML and Javascript, with WebGL Libraries to allow the browser to access the user's GPU.
      <br>
      This experiment was released in 2011, and has since inspired countless other projects,
      ranging from interactive narratives to data visualizations.
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: <a href="https://dillasdonuts.shop/">J Dilla's Donuts</a>
      pays tribute to a legend of the American Hip-Hop scene.
      It has humbler aims than RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK" did. While 3 Dreams aimed to show off the technology,
      Dilla's Donuts Shop uses it as an ordianry feature within the website. This shows the normalization
      of this technology - what was in 2011 a cutting-edge experiment was used a decade later as a normal tool
      meant to take back stage to the music being showcased.
