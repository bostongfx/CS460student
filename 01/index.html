    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! The RO.ME demo was quite the experience and intro to this class's first Assignment! The catchy music paired with the abstract-art-esc visuals constantly changing had me hooked. I noticed a theme throughout all 3 "dreams", where there is a very dull setting, and wherever you move the cursor, it brightens up the environment with cool abstract art scattered throughout the path of your cursor; or the opposite, in the 2nd "dream" where you start with a vibrant setting, and as you move the cursor, a herd of wild animals follow and make the trail behind them dull and black. Given the time period this site was devloped, (2011), it seems very ahead of its time, or as a timeless piece, since the visuals are somethign that are being rendered in real time. Overall, the demo was very captivating and immersive.

      Technology: WebGl, HTML, JavaScript, 3D visual models, Google Chrome, and the Machine Visual Card (to reneder immages), are just some of the technologies mentioned in the brief video.  <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: The WebGL example i chose to compare to RO.ME was <a href="https://www.no-fishing.net/" target="_blank">No Fishing.</a> Similar to RO.ME, No Fishing starts with a video, but here the audio is the focus, providing statistics on how fishing nets and overfishing are damaging the oceans. While No Fishing is interactive, it feels more self-paced, allowing users to explore a globe. Users can click on ships, like Farley Mowat, to read about their history and actions against ocean pollution. In contrast, RO.ME is more linear, with no place to stop and explore until the end, where you can click "Keep Exploring." Though their objectives are different, both use WebGL and 3D interactivity to create immersive experiences.<!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
