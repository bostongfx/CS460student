      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME showcases a mixture of 2D graphics, video clips, and 3D graphics,
      all utilizing WebGL to create a comprehensive music video experience that is really unique and almost game like. 
      It begins with video clips, but quickly you are thrust into an abandoned city landscape, plains, and a desert, which seems
      to be procedurally generated, along with the random entities which follow the mouse cursor.
      I thought it was cool how things followed the mouse cursor, and you were able to control the birds and fly
      around at the end. It reminded me more of a game than a music video.

      Comparison: <a HREF="https://www.sgrappa.com/index.html">SGRAPPA </a>
      This website is a storefront, which utilizes WebGL. It differs from RO.ME, because the 3D,
      hardware accelerated elements are not a main focus for the page. Instead, these WebGL elements are used for accents here and there,
      like cool 3D rendered shapes which rotate as the page moves. This implementation of WebGL is more simple compared to RO.ME but
      does a lot to add some flare to the website.  <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
