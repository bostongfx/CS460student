    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->
      <img id='screenshot' src='img/ROME_SS.png'>
      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The RO.ME demo plays a short interactive story where the viewer 
      can use their mouse to interact with the video. The demo showcases
      three dreams that the viewer lives through with the song "Black"
      playing in the background. As you move your mouse,
      you can control the movement of a group of animals 
      that leave behind a trail as they move. In other parts of the video,
      you can simply look around at the environment. This is different from 
      other music videos because it is made with code rather than a 
      film software. This was huge for the graphics community since it 
      showcased the power that the GPU and WebGL have.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'> <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
          Technology: The demo, as said before, uses code rather than a
          film software to generate all the models in realtime. To generate
          the models, the demo uses the computer's GPU and a browser that 
          runs WebGL. This allows the video to play without needing a 
          plugin.
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'> <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      Comparison: "Dilla's Donuts" is another WebGL site that includes music.
      This site pays tribute to the 18th anniversary of J Dilla's Donuts. 
      Comparing this site to RO.ME, "Dilla's Donuts" has more music variety. It
      looks a little better because there isn't as much going on and, personally,
      I just like the shape of a torus. However, it isn't as "fun" to interact with. 
      With RO.ME, you can control the animals at appear in the dreams. They leave a trail
      and follow your mouse around. When you hover over a donut in "Dilla's Donuts,"
      you can hear a bit of the music they sang. You can also click on it to see more 
      information about it. It plays more like an informative site rather than a fun one,
      like RO.ME.
