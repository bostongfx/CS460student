    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->

      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo that lets you interact with the world seamlessly. There is audio 
      and it is very interactive with great graphics. The audio made me think alot and even reflect on the song.
      I think RO.ME is great because it inspires me to think about making a short movie like this that 
      is interactive. It was created in 2011 which is mind blowing considering the advancements of technology
      since then it is really awesome to see.

      <p id='technology'>

      Technology: The technology used in RO.ME was webgl using HTML5 canvas which enables the hardware-accelerated
      graphics.

      Comparison: <a href="https://www.sgrappa.com/allcocktails.html?go=sgrappa-e-menta-page" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>

      Comparing this website that advertises cocktail drinks, and other kinds of drinks. It shows that webgl can be used for many
      things, not just movies. This website is fully interactive and you can even click on the drinks and see the ingredients, and 
      images of the drink(s). There are even some nice sculptures and art here as well. It shows the full use of webgl and the potential.
